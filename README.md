This project allows users to record audio, transcribe lyrics, and search for song information based on the transcription. 

The front end is done through Streamlit. Streamlit records audio from your microphone and sends it to Assembly AI for transcription. After returning the results, the proposed lyrics are sent to Musix Match via their API to get matching songs. The results are processed, and the top ten song matches are displayed.
